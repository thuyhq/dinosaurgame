                <h2>About Dinosaur game</h2>
                <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://thenextweb.com/google/2014/09/25/googles-latest-chrome-build-hidden-game-can-play-offline/">Dinosaur game</a> (or also called with other names like <strong>dinosaur game google</strong>, <strong>chrome dinosaur game</strong>, <strong>offline dinosaur game</strong>, <strong>no wifi dinosaur game</strong>, and <strong>t rex game</strong>) is one of the most interesting and addictive <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/doodles?q=interactive">google games</a>.

I am also sure that you don't feel strange anymore with this game because it is so familiar.</p>
                <p>In dinosaur game, you will control a simple but lovely run-automatically dino with the main mission is to avoid all the obstacles on your way. Your objective is to run as far as possible as well as score as many points as you can.On this race, there are lots of Cactus and duck. Any touch can make you lose and the game over. The cactus appears right when you jump into the game world while the duck only appears after you get 450 points. In addition, when you join this game, at first the background of the game is white. After every multiple of 700 points for the next 100 points, the game will enter the black background mode. This makes the game a bit difficult and requires you to adapt to this change.</p>
